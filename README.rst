Coverage Tools
--------------

This package is a collection of command line tools for
`coverage <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage>`_ to produce verbose reports
and/or stats measurements of your test coverage.

Available tools include:

* coverage-annotate - prints the source code and prefixes each line with + or -
  depending on wheather it was executed during testing or not;
* coverage-diff - compares the annotated sources from two coverage data files to
  highlight the difference in test coverage between them;
